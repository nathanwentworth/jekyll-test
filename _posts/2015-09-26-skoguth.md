[SKÃ“GUTH](https://wickedly.itch.io/skoguth) is a short, atmospheric first-person experience about hunting an ancient god. It has three endings, unsettling sound design, and a lot of fog. Made by three students in a month.

"With your one bullet, and a neat visor effect that reminds of Metroid Prime and Halo. Really, you'll explore. You'll conjure a story from the various details in the environment, including this Easter Island statue-y thing, and some interesting piles of little stones."
